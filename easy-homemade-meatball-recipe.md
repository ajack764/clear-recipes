# Ingredients

* 1 pound 80% lean ground beef (could sub with half ground pork)
* 1 large egg (beaten)
* 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup finely chopped onion
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 Tablespoons Chopped fresh Italian Flat leaf parsley (_optional_)

For serving: Marinara and cooked noodles , _optional_
    
# Recipe Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with non-stick spray. 

2. Combine the meat, egg, breadcrumbs, cheese, salt, garlic, onion, black pepper and parsley in a bowl. Stir just until combined, do not over mix. Add a Tablespoon or two of water as needed to keep a wet mixture. 

3. Use a medium cookie scoop or spoon to scoop the meat. Then form into 1 1/2"  balls and place on the pan. 

4. Bake uncovered for 17-20 minutes, or until no longer pink in the middle. Turn halfway through, so the bottoms don't brown. 

5. Simmer meatballs with marinara sauce for 10 minutes and serve over noodles if desired.

# Notes

## How to fry meatballs
You can also cook in a pan with 2 Tablespoons oil over medium-high heat for 7-10 minutes, or until cooked through. 

## Substitutes
You can use 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and onion powder if you do not have fresh garlic and onions. 

If I have pork on hand, I like to use 1/2 pound ground beef and 1/2 pound ground pork. It creates juicier meatballs.
