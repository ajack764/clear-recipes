# Ingredients

* 8 ounces cream cheese *softened*
* 1 Â½ cups sour cream
* 1 packet taco seasoning or *homemade taco seasoning*

# Toppings (choose your favorites)

 * iceberg lettuce
 * shredded cheddar
 * diced tomatoes
 * jalapenos
 * sliced black olives
 * green onions *or red onions*

# Recipe Preparation

1. Mix cream cheese with a hand mixer on medium until fluffy.
2. Add sour cream and taco seasoning. Mix to combine.
3. Spread into a dish (any size, I used a 10" dish) and chill.
4. Top with desired toppings and serve.

# Dip Tips
* **Soften cream** cheese before blending (this can be done in the microwave at 60% power for about 40 seconds or until soft).
* If time allows, **make ahead** and chill to allow the flavors to blend.
* Reduced fat products do work well in this recipe.
* Make **individual servings** in mini bowls or cups (with a spoon if needed).
* To make sure your cream cheese is perfectly dippable and scoopable **beat the cream cheese with a mixer** until light and fluffy. This makes a softer creamy layer.
